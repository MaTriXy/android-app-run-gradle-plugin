#### wtf?

Do you really want to just install apk on device? +
Or you are actually developer and want to start it and see results like.. right now? +
 Fear no more. Present magic piece of code, that can save you about 37 sec per month.


#### how to apply

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'ae.vigilancer.android.run'`
// or //apply plugin: 'ae.android.run'

repositories {
   jcenter()
}

buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "ae.vigilancer.gradle.plugin:android-run:1.0.0"
    }
}
----

#### how to use

Run `./gradlew tasks` and find `Running tasks` group. +
You'll see something like this:

[source]
----
Running tasks
....
runArmFreeappDebug - Install and run DebugArmFreeapp build.
runArmFreeappSomethingBlue - Install and run SomethingBlueArmFreeapp build.
runArmPaidappDebug - Install and run DebugArmPaidapp build.
runArmPaidappSomethingBlue - Install and run SomethingBlueArmPaidapp build.
----

*In example above there are no tasks for Release variants since test project have no signingConfig for Release.
